# Web Services Project (Fall 2016) 

By John O'Sullivan

=============================================================================================================================

For project I decided to go the no-sql way. (MongoDB)

1) Install MongoDB at https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/

2) Once installed launched the monogd server.

3) Run the AppTest.java as a JUnit Test.
