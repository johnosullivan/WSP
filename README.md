# Web Services Project (Fall 2016) John O'Sullivan 

=============================================================================================================================

For project I decided to go the no-sql way. (MongoDB)

1) Install MongoDB at https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/

2) Once installed launched the monogd server.

3) Run the AppTest.java as a JUnit Test.

Supporting Libraries Needed For Java Project (Located in Jars folder at root)

### <b>Note: This is running on a free dyno (Heroku). Requests will initially take longer to allow server to boot up. If you are running from eclipse please check the client and DAL configs to insure proper use, <a href="https://github.com/johnosullivan/WSP/blob/master/src/client/jacksonClient/ClientConfig.java">ClientConfig</a> and <a href="https://github.com/johnosullivan/WSP/blob/master/src/dal/Configs.java">Configs</a>. This requests below are examples with mock data. Make sure to have valid IDs or you will get a 400 status code.</b> 

Hosted: <a href="https://fall2016wsp.herokuapp.com/">https://fall2016wsp.herokuapp.com/</a>

Postman Test <a href="https://github.com/johnosullivan/WSP/tree/master/src/client/jacksonClient">Here</a>

The following rest call for the documentation were made with a Mac app called CocoaRestClient which can be downloaded and installed <a href="http://mmattozzi.github.io/cocoa-rest-client/">Here</a>. If one choose to run in eclipse I would <b>strongly recommended</b> this to build payloads and view responds without have to filter through the server output in eclipse. The ClientTestLogs.txt is the ouput from the Postman test. There are four situations, two are creating,editing,deleting data around the partner and customer objects. One is about creating,editing,deleting products and searching for then. The last Postman test will do a full order and test what the customer and partner see after an order created.
